# Notion Blog

This is an example Next.js project that shows Next.js' upcoming SSG (static-site generation) support using Notion's **private** API for a backend.

**Note**: This example uses the experimental SSG hooks only available in the Next.js canary branch! The APIs used within this example will change over time. Since it is using a private API and experimental features, use at your own risk as these things could change at any moment.

**Live Example hosted on Vercel**: https://notion-blog.vercel.app/
